# Showcase: Projectile Motion Lecture

This example demonstrates how `Synchronik` can orchestrate a multi-step calculation, presenting it as a "short lecture" with clear, sequential steps and milestone-driven progress.

**Scenario:** We want to calculate the characteristics of a projectile launched from the ground with an initial velocity and angle, under constant gravity. The steps include:

1. Setting Initial Conditions
2. Calculating Initial Velocity Components
3. Calculating Time to Peak Height
4. Calculating Maximum Height
5. Calculating Total Time of Flight
6. Calculating Horizontal Range
7. Generating Lecture Notes File

This example is best viewed by running the source code, but it effectively demonstrates how a complex, ordered workflow can be modeled cleanly using a `sequential` process.
